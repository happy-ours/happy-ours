# Problem Domain 

An app that finds just more than a bar.

Having  a application that shows bar information and informs the user/clinet with not only the resturants information, they could also get outdoor seating, weather condition along with a route on how to get there and a estimate distance, and the daily sunset so anyone intersested in catching the sunset and grabbing a good deal on a drink
